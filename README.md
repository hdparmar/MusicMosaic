# MusicMosaic
MusicMosaic: A music search and discovery platform using NLP, Spotify, and lyrics API in a micro-services architecture.
This project serves as a learning exercise in JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and the MQTT protocol. It provides a hands-on experience with these technologies by building a real-world application.

## Features

- User-friendly search: Enter a sentence describing the music you're looking for, and get a list of matching songs from Spotify.
- OAuth2 authentication: Log in with your Spotify account to get personalized recommendations.
- Microservices architecture: The application is split into several services communicating over MQTT, demonstrating the use of this protocol in a microservices context.


Stay tuned for more updates!
